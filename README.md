# Thi Module 12 Challenge
## Overview
In this project, I help Roza create a dynamic website from the data collected from the study of bacteria in belly button ([samples.json](https://github.com/Thinguyen23/Thi_Module12/blob/master/samples.json)).

Each volunteer in the study is assigned an ID number. When a number is selected, the website will show information of the selected volunteer including:
- Demographic information on the left-side panel
- A bar chart of top 10 bacterial species in the volunteer's belly button
- A gauge chart showing the frequency of wash per week
- A bubble chart showing the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteerâ€™s navel
 
## You can find the completed website here:
